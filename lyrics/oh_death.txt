Ooh death
Whooooah death
Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?

Well what is this that I cant see 
With ice cold hands taking hold of me

Well I am death none can excel 
I'll open the door to heaven or hell
Whoa death someone would pray 
Could you wait to call me another day

The children prayed the preacher preached
Time and mercy is out of your reach
I'll fix your feet so you can't walk  
I'll  lock your jaw so you can't talk

I'll close your eyes so you cant see 
This very hour come and go with me
Death I come to take the soul 
Leave the body and leave it cold

To drop the flesh up off the frame 
Dirt and worm both have a claim

Ooh death
Whooooah death
Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?

My mother came to my bed 
Placed a cold towel up on my head
My head is warm my feet are cold
Death is moving upon my soul
 
Oh death how you treating me
You closed my eyes so I can't see
Well you hurting my body you make cold
You run my life right out of my soul

Oh death please consider my age
Please don't take me at this stage
My wealth is all at your command
If you will move your icy hands

Oh the young, the rich, or poor 
How will like me no (?)
No wealth no land no silver or gold 
Nothing satisfies me but your soul

Ooh death
Whooooah death

Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?
Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?
Won't you spare me over ‘til a another year?
