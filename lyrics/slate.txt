[Intro]
Riff  G  Cadd9
Riff  G  Cadd9
 
[Verse 1]
Riff  G                            G/F#
 Now and then it keeps you running
D         Dsus2
 Never seems to die
Bm
 Trail spent with fear
   C
Not enough living on the outside
 
G                            G/F#
 Never seem to get far enough
D           Dsus2
 Staying in be-tween the lines
      Bm
Hold on to what you can
       C       G                C
Waiting for the end, not knowing when
 
[Chorus]
       G                             G/F#
May the wind take your troubles away
       D                       Dsus2
May the wind take your troubles away
    C
Both feet on the floor
    G
Two hands on the wheel
       D                       G
May the wind take your troubles away
 
[Instrumental]
G  G/F#  D  Dsus2
C  G  D  G
 
[Bridge]
D
 Trying to make it far enough
C                G
 To the next time zone
        D                   Dsus2
Few and far between past the midnight hour
C           G
  Never feel alone
     G/F#        Em
You're really not alone
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Riff  G                    G/F#
  Switching it over to A.M.
D                Dsus2
  Searching for a truer sound
        Bm
Can't re-call the call letters
         C
Steel gui-tar, I settle down
 
G                              G/F#
  Catching an all-night station
D                 Dsus2
  Somewhere in Lou-isiana
Bm
  Sounds like 1963
C             G           C
  But for  now sounds like heaven
 
[Chorus]
       G                             G/F#
May the wind take your troubles away
       D                       Dsus2
May the wind take your troubles away
    C
Both feet on the floor
    G
Two hands on the wheel
       D                       G
May the wind take your troubles away
 
[Outro]
       G              G/F#       Em
May the wind take your troubles a-way
       C
May the wind
                  G
Take your troubles away
 
[Instrumental]
