Capo III
 
[Intro]
Am  F  G  Am (x2)
 
[Verse 1]
Am                            F
True you ride the finest horse I've ever seen
G                           Am
Standing 16 one or two with eyes wild and green
Am                           F
 You ride the horse so well, hands light to the touch
G                                         Am
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
 
[Chorus]
Am      F
Ride on, see you
G                                         Am
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Am      F
Ride on, see you
G                                         Am
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
 
[Verse 2]
Am                               F
When you ride into the night without a trace behind
G                          Am
 Run your claw along my gut one last time
  Am                           F
I turned to face an empty space where you used to lie
    G                                                    Am
And look for the spark that lights the night through the teardrop in my eye
 
[Chorus]
Am      F
Ride on, see you
G                                         Am
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Am      F
Ride on, see you
G                                         Am
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
 
[Outro]
Am  F  G  Am (x4)
