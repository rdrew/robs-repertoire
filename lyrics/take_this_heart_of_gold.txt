Am        G/B       C               F
Take this heart of gold and melt it down,
              C            Am   G
And I'll come around, I'll come around.
            Am       G/B     C
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
G          F
And honey, I can't live a lie
       Am              G                    F
But a life without you could never steal me now.

[Verse 1]
      C                      F
Well, so much time to spend, why paint this house again,
         C                              Am        G
When the floorboards creak and pull you from your slumbers.
    Am        G/B     C
I'd hold you 'til the end,
           F
But honey even oaks must bend
    Am          G             F
If we intend to stick with one another.
 
[Chorus]
Am        G/B       C               F
Take this heart of gold and melt it down,
              C            Am   G
And I'll come around, I'll come around.
            Am       G/B     C
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
G          F
And honey, I can't live a lie
       Am              G                    F
But a life without you could never steal me now.

[Verse 2]
C
Out the door and down the drive,
            F
There is a part of me that tries
     C                         Am G
To keep that highway's call to me away.
        Am   G/B     C
And another further still
        F
That sadly never will
Am                       G         F
Feel at home no matter how long I may stay.
 
 
[Chorus]
Am        G/B       C               F
Take this heart of gold and melt it down,
              C            Am   G
And I'll come around, I'll come around.
            Am       G/B     C
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
G          F
And honey, I can't live a lie
       Am              G                    F
But a life without you could never steal me now.

I said a life without you could never steal me now
